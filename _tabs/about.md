I am a __Machine Learning Engineer__ with a slight emphasis on the _Engineering_ side. I like computers, and enjoy making systems that solve real-world problems. I hold a B.Sc in __Software Engineering__, an M.Sc in __AI__, and about __3 years__ of professional experience as Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer as of writing this.

The majority of my professional experience involves working with large-scale __tabular__ and __time-series__ data, and I enjoy it a lot. I also did a thesis on interpretable image representation learning so I also know my way around images.

On my free time, I play video games, and watch other people play video games, and discuss video games with my friendss.
