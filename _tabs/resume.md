## SUMMARY

---
I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a slight emphasis on the Engineering side. I like computers, and enjoy making systems that solve real-world problems. The majority of my professional experience involves working with large-scale tabular and time-series data.

## EXPERIENCE

### Data Scientist | May 2023 - Present

> TrendPlus AB, Tehran, Iran

- Trained and deployed a large ensemble of LSTM-based short-term forecasting models with telecom-scale amount of time series data achieving below 0.1 sMAPE error.
- Implemented a hierarchical anomaly detection model for telecom performance management data which reduced average MTTI of the network in a live environment.
- Designed and trained a word2vec-based model for learning network alarm embeddings to compress correlated network alarms.
- Implemented a root cause analysis method for network issues based on association rule mining.

### Machine Learning Engineer | Nov 2021 - Jan 2023

> Alibaba Travels, Tehran, Iran

- Developed a goal oriented regression model for flight pricing which achieved below 0.1 sMAPE error.
- Implemented a dynamic pricing reinforcement learning agent for flights based on offline-RL approach.
- Trained and deployed a short term demand forecasting model for flight routes using an ensemble of ARIMA and LSTM based models.
- Implemented ETLs and preprocessing data pipelines using PySpark and Airflow.

### Machine Learning Engineer (Part-time) | Aug 2020 - Oct 2021

> MCI R\&D Lab, SUT, Tehran, Iran

- Trained large vision and language models using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel approach.
- Configured an on-premise Kubernetes and Hadoop cluster for distributed processing.
- Maintained on-premise kubeflow for resource allocation, and distributed training of deep learning models.
