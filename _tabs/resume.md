## SUMMARY
---
Machine Learning Engineer and AI graduate experienced in developing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning systems. Passionate about developing prototypes to solve real-world problems; and transforming them into well-designed production-grade machine learning systems.

## EXPERIENCE

### Machine Learning Engineer Nov 2021 - Jan 2023
Alibaba Travels Co. (Dynamic Pricing Team) Tehran, Iran

- Led the research and development of a dynamic pricing reinforcement learning agent for airlines that involved system design, feature engineering, experimentation and training, evaluation, model selection, and serving.
- Developed an Imitation Learning Agent for flight pricing on scarce expert’s historical data using XGBoost, which achieved 84% on R2 score.
- Trained and deployed a price forecasting model for flights using temporal fusion transformers that improved the R2 Score of the baseline by 13%.
- Proposed and Implemented a streaming/batch data pipeline (feature extraction and storage) using spark that increased the scalability of the machine learning projects and simplified serving B2B AI models.

### Machine Learning Engineer (Part-time) Nov 2020 - Oct 2021
Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab, Sharif University of Technology Tehran, Iran

- Configured and maintained the Kubernetes cluster on the lab’s infrastructure which simplified orchestration and provision of Lab’s resources.
- Setup and configured Kubeflow which provided user management, resource allocation, and tools for developing ML pipelines and distributed training for students.
- Increased cluster utilization by implementing distributed training benchmarks for identifying and optimizing bottlenecks.
